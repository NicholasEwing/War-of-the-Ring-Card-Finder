# War of The Ring - Event Card Finder

In this project, I've created a web application where you can search and find event cards from the popular War of the Ring (2nd Edition) board game.

Technologies used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express / EJS
- MongoDB / Mongoose
- Heroku

TODO:

- **Data Entry**
  - enter all 100+ cards into the system (might have to do this manually)
  - add improved text for all cards
  - check for typos
  - check for typos AGAIN
- **Polish**
  - clean up CSS file
