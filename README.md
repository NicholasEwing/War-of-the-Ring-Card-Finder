# War of The Ring - Event Card Finder

In this project, I've created a web application where you can search and find event cards from the popular War of the Ring (2nd Edition) board game.

Technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express / EJS
* MongoDB / Mongoose
* Heroku

TODO:
* ~~Put in sample cards~~
* ~~Create JSON file with mongoexport for seeding db later~~
* ~~change card creation form to allow images for hunt tiles~~
* ~~change card schema to include optional hunt tile image~~
* add optional "improved card text" to schema
* hide card creation form, test loading all cards from DB
* create search function to find card titles in DB
* get basic type-ahead feature to work
* ensure search function searchs multiple parts of a card for a keyword, not just event title
* ensure type-ahead suggestions can be navigated and selected with arrow keys + enter
* polish CSS for cards, uploading card art if needed
* enter all ~110 cards into the system, fix grammar issues and wordiness where possible
